1 The Giving Tree is an American children's 
picture book written and illustrated by Shel Silverstein. 
First published in 1964 by Harper & Row, it has 
become one of Silverstein's best-known titles, and 
has been translated into numerous languages.

This book has been described as "one of the most 
divisive books in children's literature"; the controversy stems 
from whether the relationship between the main characters 
(a boy and the eponymous tree) should be interpreted as 
positive (i.e., the tree gives the boy selfless love) or 
negative (i.e., the boy and the tree have an abusive relationship).
